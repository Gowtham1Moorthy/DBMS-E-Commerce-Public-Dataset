1. List the top 10 most sold products by order count.
SELECT product_id, seller_id, price, COUNT(*) selled FROM order_items WHERE price GROUP BY product_id, seller_id, price ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC LIMIT 10;

between price range
SELECT product_id, seller_id, price, COUNT(*) selled FROM order_items WHERE price BETWEEN 100 AND 150 GROUP BY product_id, seller_id, price ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC LIMIT 10;

2. Show the number of customers in each state, ordered by the highest count.
SELECT 
    geolocation_zip_code_prefix, 
    geolocation_city, 
    customer_state, 
    Total_orders 
FROM (
    SELECT 
        customer_state, 
        customer_zip_code_prefix, 
        COUNT(*) AS Total_Orders 
    FROM orders 
    JOIN customers ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id 
    GROUP BY customer_state, customer_zip_code_prefix 
    ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC, customer_state
) AS T 
JOIN geolocation 
    ON geolocation.geolocation_zip_code_prefix = T.customer_zip_code_prefix 
LIMIT 10;

3. Retrieve all orders that were delivered after the estimated delivery date.
SELECT 
    c.customer_id, 
    c.customer_zip_code_prefix, 
    c.customer_city, 
    c.customer_state, 
    COUNT(*) AS Total_Late_Delivery
FROM 
    orders o
JOIN 
    customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
WHERE 
    o.order_delivered_customer_date > o.order_estimated_delivery_date
GROUP BY 
    c.customer_id, c.customer_zip_code_prefix, c.customer_city, c.customer_state
HAVING 
    COUNT(*) > 1
ORDER BY 
    Total_Late_Delivery DESC;
